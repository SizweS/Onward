# Project Timeline

### Timeline

- **Day 1**: Planning and requirements gathering.
  - Define the mission, goals, and objectives.
  - Identify functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Analyze risks and constraints.

- **Day 2**: Develop wireframes and begin SwiftUI implementation.

  - Set up the SwiftUI project structure in Xcode.
  - Begin implementing the basic UI using Appleâ€™s native components (e.g., Lists, Buttons, DatePickers).

- **Day 3**: Add core features like task tracking, reminders, and progress overview.
  - Implement local data storage using UserDefaults or Core Data.
  - Add calendar and streak tracking functionality using native components (e.g., SF Symbols for streak indicators).
  - Configure local notifications for task reminders using the iOS Notifications Framework.
  - Write unit tests for each core feature during implementation.

- **Day 4**: Conduct testing and finalize documentation for release.
  - Complete and refine the documentation (README, mission document, etc.).
  - Verify all tests pass and the app aligns with TDD principles.
