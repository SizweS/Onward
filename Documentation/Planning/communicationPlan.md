# Communication Plan

### Disclaimer
As a solo developer working on the **75 Hard Challenge Tracker** app, a formal communication plan isn't strictly necessary. However, for the sake of thorough documentation and a bit of fun, here's what a communication plan would typically include—along with my own solo-developer approach to "communication."

## What a Normal Communication Plan Includes

In a multi-person project, a communication plan is vital to ensure smooth collaboration and clear information flow. A typical communication plan outlines:

1. **Communication Methods**:
   - Daily stand-ups (e.g., in-person or via Zoom).
   - Slack or Microsoft Teams for real-time messaging.
   - Email for formal updates or announcements.

2. **Frequency of Communication**:
   - Weekly progress meetings.
   - Immediate updates for blockers or risks.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - Who updates whom and about what?
   - Responsibilities for documentation and task tracking.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Shared repositories (e.g., Google Drive, Notion, GitHub).
   - Clear meeting notes and task delegation.

5. **Escalation Process**:
   - How to handle critical issues or delays.
   - Decision-making hierarchy.

## Solo Developer "Communication Plan"

Since I'm a one-person team for this project, here's how communication will actually work:

1. **Primary Communication Method**: Internal monologues and problem-solving sessions with myself.
2. **Problem Escalation**: When stuck, I’ll employ the **rubber ducky method**, where I explain the problem out loud to my trusty rubber duck. Talking it out often leads to a solution.
3. **Meeting Schedule**: Daily brainstorming sessions in my own head. I may call impromptu meetings with myself if needed.
4. **Task Management**: Updates will be tracked in my personal notes.

### Acknowledgment
A special shoutout to **Pieter Van der Wyer** for teaching me the **rubber ducky method**, which has been invaluable in my development journey. For those unfamiliar, the rubber ducky method involves explaining a coding problem to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck), which often helps clarify the issue and leads to a solution.

### Conclusion
While I won’t have formal meetings or Slack channels, I’ll ensure clear communication with myself through thoughtful problem-solving and regular check-ins—both mentally and with my rubber duck.
