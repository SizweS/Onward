# Communication Plan

### Purpose
As a solo developer working on the **Onward - Discipline & Practice Tracker** app with GitHub Copilot as my AI pair programmer, this document outlines our communication approach.

---

## Team Members

1. **Human Developer (Sizwe)**:
   - Primary developer
   - Decision maker
   - Architecture designer

2. **GitHub Copilot**:
   - AI pair programmer
   - Code suggestion assistant
   - Documentation helper

3. **Rubber Duck ðŸ¦†**:
   - Problem-solving companion
   - Debugging assistant
   - Scope creep prevention officer

---

## Communication Methods

1. **Developer-Copilot Communication**:
   - Direct prompts in VS Code
   - Code suggestions and completions
   - Documentation assistance
   - Code review discussions

2. **Rubber Duck Debugging**:
   - Verbal problem explanation
   - Architecture discussion
   - Feature scope validation

3. **Documentation**:
   - GitHub repository
   - LinkedIn articles
   - Code comments
   - Planning documents

---

## Communication Schedule

1. **Development Sessions**:
   - Continuous interaction with GitHub Copilot
   - Regular rubber duck debugging sessions
   - Documentation updates after significant changes

2. **Problem-Solving Process**:
   - First: Attempt solo solution
   - Second: Consult GitHub Copilot
   - Third: Rubber duck debugging
   - Fourth: External resources if needed

---

## Documentation Standards

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Clear comments
   - Meaningful variable/function names
   - SwiftUI preview providers

2. **Project Documentation**:
   - Updated planning documents
   - LinkedIn development articles
   - GitHub README maintenance

---

### Note
While this might seem humorous for a solo project, maintaining clear communication standards (even with AI and rubber ducks) helps keep the project organized and well-documented.# Communication Plan

### Disclaimer
As a solo developer working on the **75 Hard Challenge Tracker** app, a formal communication plan isn't strictly necessary. However, for the sake of thorough documentation and a bit of fun, here's what a communication plan would typically includeâ€”along with my own solo-developer approach to "communication."

## What a Normal Communication Plan Includes

In a multi-person project, a communication plan is vital to ensure smooth collaboration and clear information flow. A typical communication plan outlines:

1. **Communication Methods**:
   - Daily stand-ups (e.g., in-person or via Zoom).
   - Slack or Microsoft Teams for real-time messaging.
   - Email for formal updates or announcements.

2. **Frequency of Communication**:
   - Weekly progress meetings.
   - Immediate updates for blockers or risks.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - Who updates whom and about what?
   - Responsibilities for documentation and task tracking.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Shared repositories (e.g., Google Drive, Notion, GitHub).
   - Clear meeting notes and task delegation.

5. **Escalation Process**:
   - How to handle critical issues or delays.
   - Decision-making hierarchy.

## Solo Developer "Communication Plan"

Since I'm a one-person team for this project, here's how communication will actually work:

1. **Primary Communication Method**: Internal monologues and problem-solving sessions with myself.
2. **Problem Escalation**: When stuck, Iâ€™ll employ the **rubber ducky method**, where I explain the problem out loud to my trusty rubber duck. Talking it out often leads to a solution.
3. **Meeting Schedule**: Daily brainstorming sessions in my own head. I may call impromptu meetings with myself if needed.
4. **Task Management**: Updates will be tracked in my personal notes.

### Acknowledgment
A special shoutout to **Pieter Van der Wyer** for teaching me the **rubber ducky method**, which has been invaluable in my development journey. For those unfamiliar, the rubber ducky method involves explaining a coding problem to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck), which often helps clarify the issue and leads to a solution.

---

### Conclusion
While I wonâ€™t have formal meetings or Slack channels, Iâ€™ll ensure clear communication with myself through thoughtful problem-solving and regular check-insâ€”both mentally and with my rubber duck.
