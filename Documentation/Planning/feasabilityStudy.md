## Technical Feasibility

### **Strengths**
1. **Familiarity with Swift and SwiftUI**:
   - Leveraging SwiftUI ensures adherence to Appleâ€™s design principles and allows for faster development.
2. **Native iOS Development**:
   - Tools like Xcode, UserDefaults, Core Data, and the Notifications Framework are well-supported and efficient for an MVP.
3. **Simple App Scope**:
   - The app is focused on tracking tasks and progress, with no complex third-party integrations.

### **Challenges**
1. **Advanced Features**:
   - Features like Core Data for detailed data persistence may throw curve balls.
2. **Testing**:
   - Writing robust unit tests while adhering to TDD might take more time than anticipated.

### **Conclusion**
Technical feasibility is **high**, with manageable learning curves for advanced features.

## Time Feasibility

### **Strengths**
1. **Defined Timeline**:
   - A 4-day project timeline is outlined with specific goals for each day.
2. **Focused MVP**:
   - Limiting the scope to essential features ensures efficient use of time.

### **Challenges**
1. **Balancing Full-Time Job**:
   - Limited time outside work hours may cause delays.
2. **Unforeseen Issues**:
   - Bugs or unexpected challenges might extend the timeline.

### **Conclusion**
Time feasibility is **moderate**, with careful planning and focus needed to stay on track.

## Resource Feasibility

### **Strengths**
1. **Existing Tools**:
   - All required tools (Xcode, GitHub, etc.) are available and familiar.
2. **Documentation and Support**:
   - Apple Developer resources and online communities (e.g., Stack Overflow) are readily available.

### **Challenges**
1. **Solo Development**:
   - Lack of external feedback during development may increase debugging time.

### **Conclusion**
Resource feasibility is **high**, as all necessary tools and resources are readily accessible.

## Financial Feasibility

### **Strengths**
1. **No Additional Costs**:
   - The app is built for personal use, with no hosting or third-party service costs.
2. **Existing Hardware**:
   - Development will be done on an existing Mac and iPhone.

### **Challenges**
- **None Identified**: The project has no financial dependencies.

### **Conclusion**
Financial feasibility is **very high**, with no significant costs involved.
