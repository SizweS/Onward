## Technical Feasibility

### **Strengths**
1. **Modern Tech Stack**:
   - SwiftUI for modern UI development
   - SwiftData for efficient data persistence
   - Native iOS frameworks for notifications
2. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - MV pattern reduces complexity
   - SwiftData eliminates need for complex data management
3. **Scope**:
   - Focused on core discipline tracking features
   - Modular design for future expansions

### **Challenges**
1. **SwiftData Learning Curve**:
   - New framework requires learning and adaptation
2. **Testing**:
   - Ensuring proper test coverage with SwiftTest

### **Conclusion**
Technical feasibility is **high**, with SwiftData simplifying data management.
