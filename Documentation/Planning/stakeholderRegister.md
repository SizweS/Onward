### Disclaimer
As a solo developer working on the **75 Hard Challenge Tracker** app, the concept of a stakeholder register is somewhat unnecessary since I am the only contributor and user. However, for the sake of documentation completeness and a bit of humor, hereâ€™s what a typical stakeholder register includesâ€”followed by my personalized, solo-developer version.

## What a Normal Stakeholder Register Includes

In a multi-person project, a stakeholder register identifies and tracks all parties involved in the project. It typically includes:

1. **Stakeholder Name**:
   - Key individuals or organizations involved in the project.

2. **Role**:
   - Their role or interest in the project (e.g., Developer, Product Owner, Client).

3. **Responsibilities**:
   - Specific tasks or decisions the stakeholder is accountable for.

4. **Communication Needs**:
   - How and when the stakeholder should be updated.

5. **Power and Influence**:
   - Their level of decision-making authority or impact on the project.

## Solo Developer "Stakeholder Register"

Since Iâ€™m the only stakeholder in this project, the register looks something like this:

| Stakeholder Name   | Role         | Responsibilities                               | Communication Needs                    | Power and Influence |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Sizwe Maluleke** | Everything   | Writing code, testing, debugging, documenting | Daily internal check-ins and monologues| Absolute            |
| **Rubber Duck**    | Silent Partner | Helping clarify problems by listening silently| Available 24/7                         | Zero                |
| **Readers** | Observers    | read the article check out the repository         | Final product delivery                 | Indirect            |
