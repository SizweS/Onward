# Mission Document

## Project Name: Onward - Discipline & Practice Tracker

### Mission Statement
To create a minimalist iOS application designed to help users build and maintain and track their discipline(s) through consistent daily practices. The app serves as both a personal tool for habit formation and an educational resource showcasing modern iOS development practices.

---

### Goals
1. **Personal Growth**: Build and maintain discipline through consistent daily practices and habits.
2. **Educational Impact**: Document the development journey using SwiftData and modern SwiftUI patterns.
3. **User Experience**: Provide a seamless interface for tracking daily disciplines and practices.

---

### Objectives
1. Develop an MVP iOS app with the following core features:
   - Disciplines system for organizing related practices
   - Daily practice tracking within each discipline
   - Progress tracking and streaks
   - Optional reminders via local notifications
2. Utilize SwiftUI and SwiftData for a modern, efficient implementation
3. Focus on simplicity and ease of use
4. Share development insights and learnings

---

### Target Audience
- **Primary Audience**: Individuals looking to build discipline through consistent daily practices
- **Secondary Audience**: iOS developers interested in SwiftUI and SwiftData implementation

---

### Deliverables
1. A functional iOS app with all MVP features implemented
2. LinkedIn articles documenting the development journey, including:
   - Architectural decisions and SwiftData implementation
   - Technical challenges and solutions
   - Insights into modern iOS development practices
3. A GitHub repository with clean, documented code

---

### Success Metrics
1. Personal daily use for tracking disciplines and practices
2. Clean, maintainable codebase using SwiftData
3. Positive feedback and engagement on development articles

---

### Timeline
- **Day 1**: Planning and requirements gathering
- **Day 2**: Swift model and basic UI implementation
- **Day 3**: Implement disciplines and practices tracking
- **Day 4**: Add reminders, testing, and documentation

---

This document will guide the development process and ensure alignment with the app's core purpose of building discipline through consistent practice tracking.# Mission Document

## Project Name: Onward

## Mission Statement
To create a minimalist iOS application designed to help users build and maintain discipline through consistent daily practices. The app serves as both a tool for personal growth through habit formation and an educational resource showcasing modern iOS development with SwiftUI and SwiftData.

---

### Goals
1. **Personal Achievement**: Build and maintain multiple disciplines through consistent daily practice tracking, habit formation, and streak monitoring.
2. **Educational Impact**: Document the development journey to showcase practical implementation of SwiftData and modern SwiftUI patterns.
3. **User Experience**: Provide a clean, focused interface for managing multiple disciplines and their associated daily practices.
4. **Simplicity**: Maintain a minimalist approach that emphasizes function over feature bloat.

---

### Objectives
1. Develop an MVP iOS app with the following core features:
   - Disciplines system for organizing related practices
   - Custom practice creation within each discipline
   - Daily practice tracking and completion
   - Progress tracking with streaks and momentum
   - Optional reminders via local notifications
2. Utilize SwiftUI and SwiftData for modern iOS development
3. Maintain simplicity in both architecture and user experience
4. Document and share development insights

---

### Target Audience
