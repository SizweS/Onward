# Risk Assessment

### Purpose
This document outlines the potential risks associated with the development of the **75 Hard Challenge Tracker** app, considering that the project is being developed by a solo developer with a full-time job.

---

## Identified Risks

### 1. **Time Constraints**
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: High
- **Description**: Balancing full-time work and app development may lead to delays in project completion.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set realistic daily goals based on available time.
  - Focus on building an MVP with only essential features.
  - Leverage TDD to reduce debugging time later.

### 2. **Scope Creep**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Description**: Adding non-essential features during development could lead to missed deadlines.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clearly define the scope in the planning phase and stick to it.
  - Maintain a backlog for future enhancements.

### 3. **Burnout**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Description**: Managing both a full-time job and solo development could lead to mental fatigue and decreased productivity.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Take regular breaks and avoid working excessively long hours.
  - Plan for downtime and personal activities.

### 4. **Technical Challenges**
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Description**: Limited experience with certain technologies (e.g., Core Data or notifications) could lead to delays.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use Appleâ€™s official documentation and developer forums for support.
  - Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks.

### 5. **Lack of Feedback**
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Description**: As a solo developer, there may be limited opportunities to receive constructive feedback during development.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Share progress with peers or on platforms like LinkedIn for informal feedback.
  - Use comprehensive testing to ensure functionality.

### 6. **Unforeseen Bugs or Issues**
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Description**: Bugs or unexpected technical issues may arise during development or testing.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use TDD to catch issues early.
  - Dedicate time for debugging during testing.

### 7. **Incomplete Documentation**
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Low
- **Description**: As a solo developer, documentation might be deprioritized in favor of coding.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Document key aspects of the project as you progress.
  - Use tools like GitHub to maintain clear README and project files.
